        <td class="Question"><b>Engagement:</b> How engaging is the app? Is it visually appealing?
            Does it have sound and animation to capture the user’s attention? Does it have a good balance of challenge and reward?</td>
        <td id="good">The app is quite engaging in my opinion. There is a very good mix of both animation and bright colours that catch the user’s attention. 
            The thing I enjoy most about this app is that it uses an old typewriter sound effect when you are completing a lesson. 
            I think this touch definitely adds to the overall engagement between the user and the app. (7/10)</td>
        <td id="okay"> Sololearn.com is definitely a very engaging app. The user of bright colours throughout the website improves its visual appeal. 
            The balance between challenge and reward is definitely something to mention, 
            as the greater you perform within the lesson the more you will be rewarded. (6/10) </td>
        <td id="good"> Codecombat.com has a very fun and engaging interface. It does this through the use of cool animations and sound effects. 
            I really like how it looks and feels so much like a proper game you would play with your friends, in comparison to a boring learning app. (8/10) </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td> Progress Tracking: How well does the app track the user’s progress? Does it provide feedback and recommendations to help the users improve their performance? 
            Does it use data to personalized to learning experience?</td>
        <td id="okay"> Typing.com does track the users progress and displaying it to them after each lesson is completed. It will grade you on both speed and accuracy which I think is an ideal mix. It will also track the users consistency with “day streaks”. 
            However, the app doesn’t give the users feedback on what areas they need to improve on. 
            Considering that there are only 2 possible areas to improve I can see why this feature hasn’t been added. (6/10) </td>
        <td id="good"> Sololearn.com tracks your progress in a great way. After each lesson you will be given “xp” which will then increase your standing on a global leader board. You can then go onto this 
            leader board and see where you are within it and how far away you are from first place. The one critique I could find is that it doesn’t directly tell you what areas you need to improve on, besides 
            this progress tracking within this app is fantastic. (9/10) </td>
        <td id="good"> Another fantastic feature and Codecombat.com is how engaging the progress tracking experience is. When you complete a level, a map will be displayed to you of all of the 
            upcoming missions you have to pass to move onto the next stage. I love how to it displayed to in such a fun format in comparison to the classic “Level 1, Level 2 ….”. 
            Once again, the only critique I could have is that it doesn’t directly tell you what areas you need to improve on. (8/10) </td>

        <td> User Experience: How user-friendly is the app? Is it easy to navigate and use? Does it have clear instructions and prompts? 
            Does it have a well-designed interface? </td>
        <td id="bad"> Typing.com is slightly above average when it comes to how user-friendly it is. When you are on the homepage, you can access all lessons very easily as they are displayed on the left-hand side of the screen. However, I think there is definitely an information overload happening, 
            as there are also different subjects listed on the left, your statistics are displayed across the top and your progress in your selected subject will be displayed as well. 
            If they were to hide a lot of this information behind pages it would make the website look a lot cleaner. (4/10)</td>
        <td id="good"> Sololaern.com has a very user-friendly website. I found that the homepage was lot easier to navigate and comprehend than the typing.com homepage. I liked how you were given a very minimal amount of information to take in and how it only displayed the 
            mandatory items such as your streak and course progress. (8/10) </td>
        <td id="good"> I found Codecombat.com very user-friendly. When you open it up you are asked if you are a student, parent or educator and once you answer that question you are free to complete as many levels as you want. I limitations on how many questions you are asked definitely 
            improves the user-friendly score. (8/10) </td>
